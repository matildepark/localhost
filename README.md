# LOCALHOST

A Twine interactive experience by Aether Interactive. Available for purchase [here](http://aetherinteractive.itch.io/localhost).

## What is this repository?

LOCALHOST was developed from July 28th to August 25th, 2017. I was the sole programmer. After LOCALHOST was released, a lot of the praise was directed at how it was executed in the Twine 1.4.2 engine. This repository is a **partial dump of the source code** so that other Twine authors might see how it was structured and make similar games in the engine.

If you get use from the source code, we highly appreciate if you pick up a copy of LOCALHOST for you or your best friends (or worst foes, either way).

## What isn't in the repository?
Everything I **didn't** do, basically:
- none of the art assets
- none of the music
- Some of [Furkle](http://furkleindustries.com)'s previous JavaScript scripts for us were used during the cell phone sessions, and they cannot be found here, either.

## Who is this repository for?
Twine authors. Web developer artists. Potential translators of the LOCALHOST script, should they be interested in making a copy of LOCALHOST available in their language of choice.

## How do I use this?
The .tw twee file can be imported in Twine 1.4.2 or opened in any code editor. Various language extensions exist for syntax highlighting of Twee code. See your editor's package directory for assistance.
